# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the project that I coded in the first year of my university.
I coded a simple AI that plays against human.

the process of choosing a cell to play, take 5 steps:
step 1: it checks to see if it can win the game.
step 2: it checks to see if it can prevent the opponent's win.
step 3: it chooses one of the corner cells randomly if at least one of them is empty.
step 4: it chooses the center cell if it's empty.
step 5: it chooses one of the side cells randomly if at least one of them is empty.
